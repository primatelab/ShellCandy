# ShellCandy
_Making bash look sweet_

ShellCandy is a small set of shell functions and keybindings for your bash environment to add FISH-style syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

## What ShellCandy is:
- Awesome
- Free
- Simple to use. Just source it in your `.bashrc` and forget.

## What ShellCandy is not:
- A shell. It's written in shell script. That would be like a making a hat out of hats.
- A readline replacement. ShellCandy writes pretty text to the terminal *on top of* your readline input without replacing or overriding the bash readline library. If you want something that replaces bash readline entirely, check out the ri*donk*ulously cool [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh).
